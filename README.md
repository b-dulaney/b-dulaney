## 🤠 About Me
I'm a software engineer based in Denver, CO.

I've been building React and Angular apps professionally for 5+ years. For the last couple of years I've been transitioning into more full-stack development with Python and Go. Currently enjoying building things with SvelteKit when I'm not outdoors.

[PowderHound](https://powderhound.io/) is an app that I created to stay on top of the best ski conditions in Colorado. The app tracks terrain status at every major resort in Colorado and uses forecast data from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC) to send email alerts when it's going to be a powder day. In addition to ski resorts, the app also tracks conditions and avalanche danger at popular backcountry locations across the state. Built with SvelteKit, Go, and Supabase.
